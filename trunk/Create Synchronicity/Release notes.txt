Change Log
NEW: New feature; FIX: Bug fixed; UPD: Update/Improvement; !: Important modification
--------------------------
Jul. 25, 2009 - UPD: !60% average speed increase by rewriting the syncing module (31 -> 24s).
Jul. 25, 2009 - UPD: !Create Synchroicity now copies file attributes.
Jul. 21, 2009 - FIX: !Final fix for a FAT-related bug: file copies from NTFS to FAT are now accurate and not redundant. See http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2824316&group_id=264348&atid=1130882 and/or http://support.microsoft.com/kb/127830/en-us/.
Jul. 14, 2009 - FIX: More accurate folder selection.
Jul. 13, 2009 - FIX: If the time difference between files is below 1.0s, consider it is a windows bug and the files are the same (windows has lots of difficulties handling time/date on different hard drives).
Jul. 13, 2009 - FIX: Windows is packed up with bugs of all kinds: allow multiple instances of the application to run, as the opposite made the application unstable on some copies of XP.
Jul. 13, 2009 - UPD: !By using a new way to calculate the scanning speed, Create Synchronicity is now 3 times faster. (1m, 14s -> 31s)
Jul. 12, 2009 - UPD: A new mechanism is used to store configuration.
Jul. 12, 2009 - NEW: !Create Synchronicity can now check for updates automatically.
Jun. 21, 2009 - NEW: Option to not propagate updates, fixing a windows-related bug (when copying a file, 2 seconds are added to the actual last-write date).
Jun. 21, 2009 - NEW: Create Synchronicity can now compute MD5 hashes.
